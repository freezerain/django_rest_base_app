# Django endpoint tests

"""
To test your app, you need to consider the following aspects:

Models: You need to test the functionality and validity of your User and Event models, such as creating, updating, 
deleting, and querying instances. You can use pytest fixtures to create some sample data for your tests, and use the 
Django ORM methods or the DRF serializers to interact with the models. You can also use pytest.mark.parametrize to 
test different scenarios and inputs for your models2. 

Serializers: You need to test the serialization and 
deserialization of your User and Event models, such as converting them to and from JSON or other formats. You can use 
the DRF serializer classes and methods to perform the serialization and deserialization, and use assert statements to 
check the expected output. You can also use pytest.mark.parametrize to test different scenarios and inputs for your 
serializers3. 

Views: You need to test the functionality and behavior of your API views, such as handling GET, POST, 
PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests, performing authentication, authorization, and throttling, and returning the 
appropriate status codes and data. You can use the DRF APIClient or the pytest-django plugin to make requests to your 
API endpoints, and use assert statements to check the expected responses. You can also use pytest.mark.parametrize to 
test different scenarios and inputs for your views45.
